        <p>This is my recreation of the classic minesweeper game. This page was created as a final project for CS50, Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming.</p>
        <p>For best play experience, using mouse is recommended. Hope you enjoy the game!</p>
